## The Price of Time

Drowning deeply in endless shame,  
Desiring wealth and wanting for fame.  
Upon this deathbed, tired, I stare,  
Through broken windows in the cold night's glare.  
Suffered not by the cancer that spread inside my brain.  
But the guilt, hatred, and pain.  

Hours cramming exams each night.  
My brain is overdosing with an oversight  
Mocking my friends, arrogant with pride.  
Never care about others, always believing I am right.  
Until all my friends left me, and I'm alone inside.  

Keyboards snapping, fan still blowing,  
Working late shifts, my thoughts are numbing.  
Paralyzed muscles, consciousness fading,  
Another coffee, documents uploading.  
Missing appointments, health slowly eroding.  
Forget my 10th anniversary, all I do was neglecting.  

Until I was about to die, I realized I was wrong.  
For a beautiful family I have all I do was ignore.  
Never caring about my friends, spending all my time on that score.  
But really, we should be is loving ourselves and love the people we care for.  
And that friendship, love and community is what really matter  
Because in reality, we spent all our money,  
On repairing our body and mind  
When we really should have just spent time.  

## Reflection

In my poem "The Price of Time," the theme is about people that are often prioritizing wealth and status over family and friendships. This theme connects to the real world context where the poem also provide the message of the pressure that society gives to individuals due to the competition in academic and life success. 

I use imagery throughout the poem; for example, I use sentences such as "broken windows in the cold night's glare" and "keyboards snapping, fan still blowing" and "paralyzed muscles, consciousness fading," to develop a image of being pressurized, social isolation and a declining health. I want to create an oppressive mood that further shows the downsides of social pressure that lead to people to study or work at late night while deteriorate their own health and well-being. 

Next, I've employed multiple poetic devices including alliteration in "Desiring wealth and wanting for fame," anaphora in repeated phrases like "Never caring about my friends," and internal rhymes throughout the poem. I also use metaphor of "my brain is overdosing with an oversight" to further develop the burdening mood conveyed throughout the poem. 

My poem's structure is organized into four stanzas. My poem uses a rhyme scheme throughout the poem. For example, I rhyme the "ame" and "ight" in "shame"/"fame", "night"/"oversight" in the first two stanzas. I also sometimes use free rhymes, as shown in "pride"/"right"/"inside" in stanza 4. The poem uses intentional enjambment such as "But the guilt, hatred, and pain".  

Furthermore, each stanza describes a different aspect of life's regrets. For example, the first stanza introduces broad themes of shame, regret, and mortality. The second stanza describe the personal failures like arrogance. And the the last stanza concludes with self-realization and reflection, giving the overall theme about life priorities, relationships, and community. 

The poem strongly evokes feelings of regret, shame, and self reflection. The depressing mood can be shown in lines of "Drown deeply in endless shame" and "Until all my friends left me, and I'm alone inside"—offer direct access to the speaker's self-criticism and isolation. Images like "Paralyzed muscles, consciousness fading" and "health slowly eroding" show clearly how exhaustion from work and studying can affect a person's life negatively, which also provides real-world context to current pressured school and social life that I've faced. 

Toward the end, the speaker realizes that they have ignored what really matters in life—relationships, family, and friendships. Lines like "Until I was about to die, I realized I was wrong," and "we really should have just spent time" which highlights the emotions of self-reflection and also impacts the reader to think about their own life, how they should be themselves, not be conformed by society and others. 

This poem inspired from my own experience participating in iGEM competitions. During that time, I missed important social events, like my friend's birthday, because I was always busy meeting project deadlines. This made me realize that my priorities were unhealthy. Writing this poem helped me feel better and allowed me to rethink what really matters in life. It showed me the importance of balancing achievement with relationships. I also realized that many successful people spend a lot of money later fixing their health problems caused by working too hard. This made me clearly see that instead of working too hard and needing to spend money fixing damage later, we should simply spend quality time with people we care about from the start.
